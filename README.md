# Python-IP-camera #

# One Time Setup:
- Install latest Python version if you don't have it
- Create a directory named 'images' in the same directory as all the script files.
- Run 'requirements.bat'
- Edit login details in 'config.py'
- Edit videoCapture url/rtsp inside 'capture.py' (Must be in the right format for your specific IP camera)
- Test run 'video.py' to see if your video stream shows up. If so, you've done everything right and you're good to go. 
	Else it's something wrong with your installation or with your video stream capture URL most likely.

# Start Program:
- Run 'start.bat'
